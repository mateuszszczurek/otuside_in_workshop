Write a shopping aid system that will allow the user to:
* add items to the shopping list
* specify maximum amount of money to spend
* offer cheaper alternatives while adding products
* get items from the list based on category (groceries, manufactured goods)
* assign shopping lists to particular dates
* add 'recipes' to shopping list

Questions that we need to answer first before starting with outside-in:
* identify the clients of the system
* identify how clients are going to interact with our system

What we need to focus on
* tests should describe the system contracts rather
* those contracts should be verified by observed behaviour
